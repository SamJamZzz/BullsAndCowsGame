# Bulls and Cows Game

Developed with Unreal Engine 4 and C++

## How to Play:

Once the game begins, hit the TAB button to access the terminal of the game. Here, you'll be asked to guess a 4-8 letter isogram (a word with no repeating letters). The number of lives you'll be given is equal to the number of letters in the hidden word. Type your guess of the appropriate length and press ENTER.

If you've guess the right word, congratulations! You'll be displayed the win screen and can press ENTER. If you didn't guess correctly, you'll be shown the number of Bulls and Cows for your guess. The number of Bulls represents the number of letters that were in the correct position of your guess. The number of Cows represent letters in your guess that are found in the hidden word but are in the wrong position.

Use these clues to help you win the game and best of luck!
